# odin-calculator

My version of TOP's Project: Calculator. You can find the directions I followed to create the basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator)!

## What?

This project is to create a webpage that mimics a calculator. At this point, the calculator can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Also, it can handle decimals. This project has one HTML file, one CSS file, and one JavaScript file.

## Why?

This project exists to develop my skills in using classes in HTML, pseudo-classes in CSS, and user interaction in JavaScript. Further, this project exists to increase the complexity of the code I am writing.
